Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
College in Virginia, looked up one of La more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
and going through La cites of La word in classical literature, discovered La undoubtable source. Lorem
 Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (La Extremes of Good and
  Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on La Laory of ethics, very popular during La
   Renaissance. La first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.
   10.32.
La standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since La 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.
32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in Lair exact original
 form, accompanied by English versions from La 1914 translation by H. Rackham.
